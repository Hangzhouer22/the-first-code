#We will also drop the 'gdpp' variable for now, because we want to see if we can identify clusters of

# In[23]:


#Cluster Profiles:

#Cluster 2 has only 3 observations. As observed from the scatter plots and the boxplots, this group 
#consists of outlier high income countries with the highest percentages of imports and exports in terms of GDP.
#Cluster 1 seems to have countries with less desirable values for many indicators. These countries seem 
#to have the highest inflation rates, the lowest GDP per capita, the lowest exports as well as 
#imports - all signaling a very poor economic situation. These countries also have the highest child 
#mortalities, the highest fertility rates, and the lowest life expectancies. These characteristics are 
#traits of underdeveloped or developing countries. These countries also seem to have a trade deficit, 
#i.e., more imports than exports, and as a consequence, may be more reliant on borrowing and lines of
#credit to finance their economy.
#Cluster 0 is the largest cluster with traits of countries that fall in the middle of the development 
#spectrum. These countries have a comparatively better state of affairs than the countries in cluster 1. 
#However, this cluster has a large range of values, indicating that it is a mix of many different types of 
#countries. Ideally, we do not want a cluster to be like this as the fundamental idea behind clustering is 
#to 'group similar things' and this cluster seems to have a lot of 'dissimilarity' within it.
#Overall, this clustering solution does give us good insights into potential clusters of similar countries
#but is not very useful as it is impacted by outlier countries resulting in one very small cluster and 
#two very big clusters. We should try other algorithms to see if we can do better.


# In[24]:


#But before that, let's validate if these clusters relate well with the GDP of the country.

# In[26]:


#Observations:

#The countries with higher fertility rates also seem to have higher populations, corresponding
#with lower per capita income in these countries.
#The child mortality also seems to be negatively correlated with the GDP of the country. 
#The high child mortality in such countries could be due to several reasons such as high poverty or 
#lower net income per person and a relative lack of health facilities among others.

# In[34]:


#Cluster Profiles:

#Cluster 2 countries have the highest average child mortality rate, trade deficit, inflation 
#rate and least average GDP and net income per person. But the large range of values for different 
#variables implies that cluster 2 contains a variety of countries, from underdeveloped to developing ones.
#Cluster 1 shows traits of developing countries with comparatively higher GDP, net income per person 
#and significantly lower child mortality rate as compared to cluster 2. The cluster consists of 
#some outliers but majorly it consists of countries with low to medium GDP, with a comparatively 
#higher percentage of imports and exports vs GDP.
#Cluster 0 shows traits of highly developed countries with a low child mortality rate and a 
#higher net income per person, life expectancy, and GDP. These countries have the highest average
#expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP.

#Observations:

#The number of observations for each cluster from K-Medoids is more evenly distributed in comparison 
#to K-Means clustering.
#This is because the clusters from K_Medoids are less affected by outliers from the data. As we observe,
#the three outlier countries from K-Means (in terms of imports and exports) are now included in cluster
#1 and do not form a separate cluster like in K-Means.
#Unlike in K-Means, the cluster for developed countries is much bigger but still retains the overall 
#characteristics of developed countries, as reflected in the higher values for income per person,
#life expectancy, and especially in health expenditure as a percentage of GDP.

# In[42]:


#Cluster Profiles:

#This clustering solution looks very similar to the once created using K-Medoids with
#one cluster of 'high income' countries, one of 'low income' and one of 'all the others'. 
#But on closer inspection, we can identify some important differences in this solution using GMM.

#Cluster 1 seems to be of 'developed' countries but this time the median values for all the key 
#indicators have all improved in comparison to the same cluster obtained from K-Medoids, with a 
#higher GDP per capita, higher income, higher exports and imports and marginally higher life 
#expectancy. At the same time, it has lower inflation rates, lower child mortality rates, 
#and lower fertility as well. Overall, we can say that this cluster has become more 'pure' in
#comparison to the one from K-Medoids.

#Cluster 0 seems to be of 'underdeveloped' countries but this time the median values for all the 
#key indicators have improved in comparison to the corresponding K-Medoids cluster. For e.g., it has 
#higher GDP per capita, higher income per person, higher exports and imports, and slightly better
#health expenditure and life expectancy. That means that this cluster of 'underdeveloped' countries has 
#become less 'pure'.

#Both of the above points can give an idea of what might have happened to the third cluster, i.e., 
#Cluster 2. It was a mix of 'underdeveloped' & 'developing' countries and continues to be so, but it 
#has gained some countries on the rich end of the spectrum, and some countries on the 'underdeveloped' 
#end have moved to the last cluster.

#Overall, this is a slightly more evenly distributed clustering solution than K-Medoids.

#Hierarchical Clustering


# In[44]:


#Let's try to create clusters using Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering.
#Here, we decide the number of clusters using a concept called Dendrogram which is a tree-like 
#diagram that records the sequences of merges or splits.

    axs[i].set_ylabel('Distance')


# In[47]:


#Observations:

#We can see that the complete linkage gives better separated clusters. A cluster is 
#considered better separated if the vertical distance connecting those clusters is higher.
#Now, we can set a threshold distance and draw a horizontal line. The number of clusters
#will be the number of vertical lines which are being intersected by the line drawn using
#the threshold.
#The branches of this dendrogram are cut at a level where there is a lot of âspaceâ to 
#cut them, that is where the jump in levels of two consecutive nodes is large
#Here, we can choose to cut it at ~9 since the space between the two nodes is largest.

#Observations

#We can see that while the three clusters (0, 1, and 2) seem to be way more compact across 
#all attributes, cluster -1 consists of extreme outliers on at least one attribute.
#Therefore, it is not adding any value to our cluster analysis. We can explore it further to 
#understand which type of countries it consists of.


# In[74]:


#Conclusion
#The choice of clustering algorithm here will depend on the context and use case. But purely
#based on foundations of 'what good clustering looks like', one can propose K-Medoids as it has 
#extreme clusters that are more distinct from each other.
